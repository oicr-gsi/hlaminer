## Commands
This section lists commands run by HLAminer workflow

* Running hlaminer workflow

hlaminer wraps HLAminer () tool in a cromwell workflow. HLAminer is used to profile the usage of HLA alleles in a sample. The tool works with sequence data of many types (ie. whole genome, whole transcriptome/RNA-Seq, exome), at the group and allele resolution. It supports predictions from a variety of DNA sequencing technologies including those from Illumina, MGI, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore.

The workflow takes fastq files as it's inputs and aligns using HLA-specific indexes using BWA (it is ran as a subworkflow).
Below we have the command used to run HLAminer:


```
 set -euo pipefail
 samtools view -h INPUT_BAM | HLAMINER -a stream -h HLA_FASTA -p P_DESIGNATION_FILE -l OUTPUT_PREFIX

```
