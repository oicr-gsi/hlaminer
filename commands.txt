## Commands
This section lists command(s) run by the hlaminer workflow

* Running hlaminer

hlaminer wraps HLAminer () tool in a cromwell workflow. HLAminer is used to profile the usage of HLA alleles in a sample. The tool works with sequence data of many types (ie. whole genome, whole transcriptome/RNA-Seq, exome), at the group and allele resolution. It supports predictions from a variety of DNA sequencing technologies including those from Illumina, MGI, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore.

The workflow takes fastq files as it's inputs and aligns using HLA-specific indexes using BWA (it is ran as a subworkflow).
Below we have the command used to run HLAminer:

```
 set -euo pipefail

 bwa aln -e 0 -o 0 HLA_FASTA FASTQ1 > "ALIGNMENT1_SAI"
 bwa aln -e 0 -o 0 HLA_FASTA FASTQ2 > "ALIGNMENT2_SAI"
 bwa sampe -o 1000 HLA_FASTA "ALIGNEMNT1_SAI" "ALIGNMENT2_SAI" FASTQ1 FASTQ2 > "ALIGNMENT_SAM"
 
 HLAMINER -a "ALIGNMENT_SAM" -h HLA_FASTA -p P_DESIGNATION_FILE -l OUTPUT_PREFIX
```
